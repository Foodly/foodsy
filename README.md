# Final Project- *Foodsy*

Foodsy is an application that will revolutionize the way you do meal prep and figure out what to eat. Foodsy is an application that allows you to maintain a list of
ingredients you have and then use the recipe search feature to search for a recipe that you can make with the ingredients you have (amongst other filters). It also
has a shopping list feature that allows you to search for ingredients and add them to your shopping list. In addition, you can search for grocery stores right from
the App so you are ready to go. We also allow users to favorite recipes to make it easier to make their go-to comfort food.
